# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Unclear Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI:  unclear error messages during the build process. The build may fail without providing specific details about the underlying cause.

## Problem

The Expo CLI's Android build process can unexpectedly stop, often producing vague error messages like 'Build failed' or 'An unexpected error occurred'. This makes it difficult to diagnose and resolve the underlying problem.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing the project setup, dependencies, and Android development environment.

1. **Check for Dependency Conflicts:** Ensure all project dependencies are compatible and correctly installed.
2. **Verify Android SDK Setup:** Confirm the Android SDK is correctly configured, including necessary build tools and platforms.
3. **Examine Gradle Configuration:**  Inspect the `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files to check for any syntax errors or inconsistencies.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the build cache using `expo prebuild` and then rebuilding using `expo build:android`. 
5. **Check for warnings:** Review all warnings produced during the build, as they could hint at potential issues.
6. **Consult Expo documentation:** Refer to the Expo documentation for troubleshooting and common issues related to Android builds.
7. **Review logs:** Analyze the full build logs for potential insights into the failure. The logs might be located in the Expo CLI output or within the project's Android folder.

This repository contains example code to illustrate the problem and its solution.
